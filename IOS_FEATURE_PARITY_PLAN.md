# iOS Feature Parity Plan

Bringing the Durigo iOS app to parity with the restaurant-management web app. iOS is the primary device used in the restaurant.

## Architectural decisions (revised)

### What we preserve from the existing iOS app
- **Bill Generator** — the unique iOS feature (custom items, inline name/price edit, table+waiter dropdown, PDF print). This is the only piece staff actively uses today and the only feature being kept verbatim.
- **Fonts and shared visual assets**.

### What we rewrite or replace
- Bill History (currently SwiftData-only) → server-driven with SwiftData cache
- Stats / Reports → mirror web's `/reports` endpoints
- Menu views → live from server
- Auth → JWT login matching the website
- Everything else.

### Network + auth model
- **Login is the gate.** Username + password (matching the existing web user accounts: admin/admin123, waiter/waiter123, etc.) → server returns JWT → iOS stores in Keychain.
- All API calls send the JWT as `Cookie: auth-token=<jwt>`. This is what the existing middleware (`proxy.ts`) reads; we don't need a separate auth path.
- The old bearer-token (`BILL_UPLOAD_API_TOKEN`) approach is **deprecated** for the iOS app. The endpoint stays for any future machine-to-machine integration but iOS will no longer use it.

### Storage model: SwiftData canonical + bidirectional sync
- **SwiftData = local canonical store.** Always read from SwiftData for display. Works offline by definition.
- **On app foreground (and pull-to-refresh)**:
  1. Pull from server → upsert into SwiftData (server is authoritative for already-uploaded bills)
  2. Push local-only bills (`syncedAt == nil`) → server → mark synced
- **Failures are silent** — UI keeps showing cached data; only show errors when user takes an explicit sync action.
- **Bills created offline** stay in SwiftData with `syncedAt = nil` and get uploaded next time online.

### Adaptive layout
- Every new screen uses `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)` to adapt: compact (iPhone) → `NavigationStack`; regular (iPad) → `NavigationSplitView`. No platform-specific code paths.

## Phase order (revised)

| # | Phase | Estimate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Auth foundation**: REST login endpoint, iOS Login screen, JWT cookie wiring | ~2h | in progress |
| 1 | **Bill upload** (Bill Generator → server) + **Bill history sync** (server → SwiftData) | ~3h | partial (needs auth refactor) |
| 2 | **Menu management** (CRUD via authenticated endpoints) | 1-2 days | pending |
| 3 | **Settings + Users** sync | 1 day | pending |
| 4 | **Live ops**: POS tables, Kitchen, SSE | ~1 week | pending |
| 5 | **Reports parity** (sales, customers, staff) | 2-3 days | pending |
| 6 | **Long tail**: Discounts, inventory, reservations, modifiers | ~1 week | pending |

## Phase 0 — Auth foundation (in detail)

### Server changes

**0.1 New endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login`** (REST counterpart to the existing Server Action). Body: `{username, password}`. Response on success: `{token: "<jwt>", user: {id, name, role}}`. On failure: `401 {error: "..."}`. Sets `auth-token` cookie too (for browser callers). Reuses the existing `generateToken()` and rate limit logic.

**0.2 Whitelist removed.** Bearer-token route bypass for `/api/bills` is no longer needed (iOS will use cookie auth via the existing JWT path). Keep the bearer logic in the upload endpoint as a deprecated fallback for now; remove later.

### iOS changes

**0.3 `LoginView.swift`** — username/password form. On submit, POST to `/api/auth/login`, store returned JWT in Keychain (key `authToken`), and dismiss to root.

**0.4 `Session` observable** — `@Observable` class injected via `@Environment`. Tracks `currentToken: String?`, `currentUser: User?`. Reads from Keychain on init. Provides `signIn(username:password:)` and `signOut()`.

**0.5 `APIClient` foundation** — wraps `URLSession`. Always sends `Cookie: auth-token=<jwt>` from Session. On `401`, signs out (token expired). All future iOS-side API calls go through this.

**0.6 Wire login into app entry** — `DurigoApp.body` shows `LoginView` if Session has no token, otherwise shows `Home()`.

### Testing

- iPhone 17 sim: Login → land on Bill Generator (default). Verify token stored.
- iPad Pro 13" sim: Login → split view, same flow.
- 401 from API → app returns to Login automatically.
- Logout → token cleared, returns to Login.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `/api/auth/login` REST endpoint returns JWT
- [ ] iOS login form works against localhost (and later restaurant.local)
- [ ] After login, all API calls include `Cookie: auth-token=...`
- [ ] Logout clears Keychain
- [ ] iPhone + iPad both render the Login screen correctly
- [ ] No regression to Bill Generator (still works without internet, still produces PDFs)

## Phase 1 — Bill sync (revised)

After Phase 0 lands:
- `BillUploader` refactored to use `APIClient` (cookie auth) instead of bearer token
- `BillSyncSettings` view removed (login covers it)
- History view stays SwiftData-driven, with auto-pull on foreground via `APIClient.fetchBills()`
- Existing 6,740 bills on the iPad SwiftData are picked up by the pull (server has them; sync becomes a no-op upsert)

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] iPad with 6,740 local bills + token → opens History → shows correct list, no duplicates
- [ ] Create bill in Bill Generator while offline → bill saved to SwiftData with `syncedAt = nil` → reconnects → syncs automatically → `syncedAt` populated
- [ ] Web dashboard at `/admin` reflects iOS-uploaded bill within ~1s of network being available

## What we explicitly are *not* doing
- Replacing the web app entirely
- Building a separate admin web for the Pi
- Offline writes for POS/KDS state (real-time only when online)
